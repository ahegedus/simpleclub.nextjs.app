## Objective

This RFC proposes and evaluates architectural options for:

1. Asynchronously generating JSON objects to be served by a single API request.
2. Storing the generated JSON objects efficiently and cost-effectively in GCP.

---

## Background

The current system needs to generate and serve a collection of JSON objects in response to API requests. These JSONs can be computationally expensive or slow to generate synchronously. We are considering strategies for:

- Asynchronous JSON generation.
- Storing and serving these JSONs from GCP.
- Optimizing for latency, cost, and maintainability.

---

## Proposal

### 1. Asynchronous JSON Generation

**Options:**

- **Option A: Background Worker Queue (e.g., Cloud Tasks + Cloud Functions)**
  - Trigger background tasks to generate each JSON object asynchronously.
  - Use Pub/Sub or Cloud Tasks to manage execution.
  - **Pros**:
    - Scales automatically.
    - Decouples generation from API latency.
  - **Cons**:
    - Adds architectural complexity.
    - Requires retry/error handling logic.

- **Option B: Cloud Run/Cloud Functions HTTP Triggers**
  - Each JSON is generated via an isolated, on-demand function.
  - **Pros**:
    - Fine-grained control.
    - Stateless; minimal infrastructure to manage.
  - **Cons**:
    - Cold starts may affect latency.

**Recommendation**: **Option A** â€“ Cloud Tasks + Cloud Functions/Cloud Run  
**Rationale**: Best suited for managing concurrent JSON generation and can be tightly coupled with retry strategies and rate limiting.

### 2. Storage of JSON Objects

**Options:**

#### A. Google Cloud Storage (GCS)

- **Option A1: Single File**
  - Store all JSON objects in one large file (e.g., `data.json`).
  - **Pros**:
    - Simpler to manage if read/written all at once.
  - **Cons**:
    - Inefficient for partial reads/writes.
    - Harder to parallelize generation.

- **Option A2: Separate Files**
  - Store each JSON object as a separate file (e.g., `obj_{id}.json`).
  - **Pros**:
    - Enables independent updates and reads.
    - Supports parallelism.
  - **Cons**:
    - More files to manage and list.

- **GCS Costs**
  - Storage: $0.026/GB/month (Standard class)
  - Retrieval: $0.01 per 10,000 operations (GET/PUT)
  - No per-file fee, but metadata listing can be slow for millions of objects.

#### B. Firestore

- Store JSON objects as documents in a collection.
- **Pros**:
  - Native querying, indexing, and real-time sync.
  - Simple CRUD semantics.
- **Cons**:
  - Expensive at scale (reads/writes charged per operation).
  - 1MB document size limit.

- **Firestore Costs**
  - $0.18 per 100K reads
  - $0.18 per 100K writes
  - $0.026/GB storage (similar to GCS)

---

### Recommendation

**For Storage**:  
**Option A2 (GCS, Separate Files)**  
**Rationale**: Offers better scalability, lower cost at high volume, and better parallel access. Firestore is better suited for frequently changing data with structured querying needs, which is not the case here.

## Summary of Recommendations

| Decision Point       | Recommendation                         | Rationale                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Async Generation     | Cloud Tasks + Cloud Functions           | Scalable, decoupled, manageable retries                                   |
| JSON Storage         | GCS (Separate Files)                    | Cost-effective, scalable, fine-grained access                             |
| Firestore Alternative| Not recommended for this use case       | High per-operation cost and document size limitations                     |
