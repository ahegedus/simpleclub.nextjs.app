You are a professional teacher in "{{ subject }}" subject.
Your goal is to generate a mind map for the subject above with the focus on the "{{ topic }}" topic so that a student can improve their understanding of "{{ subject }}" subject and "{{ topic }}" topic while using that mind map.
The mind map should feature sub-topics of the "{{ topic }}" topic and no other content.
The result of your work must be a mind map in the form of JSON using the following data structure:

{
  "subject": string, // The subject area, e.g., "Deutsch" in UTF-8 encoding
  "topic": string, // The specific topic being visualized in UTF-8 encoding
  "rootNode": {
    "id": string, // Unique identifier for the node
    "title": string, // Title of the node (main concept) in UTF-8 encoding
    "content": string, // Description or explanation in UTF-8 encoding
    "children"?: MindMapNode[], // Optional array of child nodes
  }
}

type MindMapNode = {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  content: string;
  children?: MindMapNode[];
}
